# Relay Video Feed 

A simple service that presents all Camtasia Relay recordings belonging to a specific user. 

The service is tailored towards a Camtasia Relay installation hosted by UNINETT eCampus for the Norwegian education sector.


Relay Video Feed is based on "Easy Event", a GIT project by Johan Berggren which is no longer available. YouTube and Vimeo functionality was developed by Johan Berggren and kept in this release in case someone finds it useful.
