# Relay Video Feed 

A simple service that presents all Camtasia Relay recordings belonging to a specific user. 

The service is tailored towards a Camtasia Relay installation hosted by UNINETT eCampus for the Norwegian education sector. It is not "plug and play", you need to develop an API on the Relay media server that provides required metadata, see the Relay plugin (relay_video_feed / static / js / plugins / vod / relay.js) for details. I may publish a repo for our Relay API at a later stage. Please contact me if you are in need for something like this and I might speed up the process....


Relay Video Feed is based on "Easy Event", a GIT project by Johan Berggren which is no longer available. YouTube and Vimeo functionality was developed by Johan Berggren and kept in this release in case someone finds it useful.
